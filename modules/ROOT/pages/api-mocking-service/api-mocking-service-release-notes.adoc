== API Mocking Service 2.3.0
*July 13, 2019*

=== Fixed Issues
// SE-12065
* Executing the Get command in RAML produces an empty response in the example data.

// SE-11762
* Request and response are not showing up in the mocking service.

== API Mocking Service 2.2.0
*June 15, 2019*

This release contains one new feature and two fixes.

=== New Feature
// MSERV-285
* Use behavioral headers with the mocking service to modify in various ways how the mocking service behaves. See xref:design-center::apid-behavioral-headers.adoc[Add Behavioral Headers to Simulated API Calls].
// MSERV-600
* Now, the mocking service supports XML serialization facets, such as `wrapped`, `attribute`, and `name`, when generating an XML response that is based on a RAML example.

=== Fixed Issues
// SE-11925
* The mocking service included invalid tags in returned XML when the data type contained an array.
// SE-11683
* The mocking service converted null values to string "null" values.


== API Mocking Service 2.1.8

*May 18, 2019*

// SE-10775
* The API Console and the mocking service were adding invalid tags to XML examples.
// MSERV-539
* Though multiple examples were defined for an endpoint, the mocking service always used the same example, rather than randomly selecting one to use.
// MSERV-620
* When an OAS API specification did not define any consuming media type for a specific endpoint, the mocking service failed.



== API Mocking Service 2.1.0

*February 23, 2019*

The following issues were resolved in this release:
// SE-10773
* For an API specification written in RAML, the mocking service returned content that was in YAML, although the returned content should have been in XML.
// SE-10865
* The mocking service returned a misleading error message when `baseURI` was invalid.

== API Mocking Service 2.1.0

The following issues were resolved in this release:

[SE-8276] - Issues with Design Center

[SE-9830] - Mock service api always return 400
[SE-9990] - JSON Schema defined inline in Design Center RAML gives error, OK on Studio
[SE-10045] - Incorrect Datetime-only format error when trying on mocking service from design center
[SE-10194] - RAML issue with optional enum type headers
[SE-10222] - additionalProperties=false in RAML are ignored by Design Center and exchange Mocking services.


== API Mocking Service 1.1.11

*August 21, 2018*

This release fixes the following issue:

* The mocking service did not return messages for the 400 response in the correct styling.


== API Mocking Service 1.1.10

*June 30, 2018*

== API Mocking Service 1.1.8

*April 21, 2018*

* Invoking a resource that required the `uriParameter` (e.g., “/master/{attname}”) returned the example response for root instead of the defined example.
* Invoking a resource that required a `uriParameter` and then using the example parameter in a GET or PUT method resulted in a response containing the complete API specification.


== API Mocking Service 1.1.7

*March 24, 2018*

This release bumps the parser and includes bug fixes.

=== Improvements

Bumped parser to 1.1.41.

== API Mocking Service 1.1.6

*February 24, 2018*

This release fixes several bugs.

=== Fixed Issues

* A problem that prevented validation datetime query parameters with format
RFC3339.

response with 0 length.
* The `multipleOf` facet validation issue.

== API Mocking Service 1.1.5

*January 13, 2018*

This release resolves a few issues:

=== Resolved Issues

* Fixed a problem related to a URI parameter name containing a hyphen (-) character.
* Fixed an issue with making a request that has a empty body of type application/json.
* Fixed a bug that returned a 400 "body: unknown type any" when using a body with an example that has no type definition.

== API Mocking Service 1.1.4

*December 16, 2017*

This release introduces the following improvements and resolved issues:

=== Improvements

* Using the mocking service from a proxy application overrides the mocking service of the API itself.
* The Authorization header check for path simulation has been removed.
* When you don't specify the main example for a DataType, the mocking service provides the examples defined for each property.

=== Resolved Issues

* Using a proxy application, the mocking service now validates the Body of the method when you try to POST it.
* Using a base URI ending with / no longer causes a 404 error.
* The mocking service now recognizes object type as an enum in a URI parameter.
* Enforcement of a required data type has been fixed. An absent data type or one that does not include all required fields is rejected.
* The problem related to using the RAML anonymous security scheme has been fixed.

== API Mocking Service 1.1.3

*October 21, 2017*

This release focuses on bug fixes.

=== Improvements

* Enhanced the Mocking Server to respond with random examples if more than one is available.

Fixed API Mocking Service to work properly when the RAML has URI parameters.
