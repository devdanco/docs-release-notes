== 1.5.5

*July 12, 2019*

=== Minimum Mule Version

*Mule 4.1.1*

=== Fixed Issues

* Remove vulnerable commons-codec library. (https://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/MULE-16799[MULE-16799])

When both the `X-Correlation-ID` and `Mule-Correlation-ID` headers are present, Mule decides on one and logs a warning message about the decision. However, if in Mule 4 and 3 both headers are duplicated with the same value, Mule logs a debug message instead. (https://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/MULE-17115[MULE-17115])
