Support Category: Premium

The IBM CICS Transaction Gateway (IBM CTG) connector provides integration with backend CICS applications using the CICS Transaction Gateway. For Java platforms, CTG implements the JCA resource adapter to connect Java applications to the CICS system. This connector provides connectivity between Mule applications and the CTG.

== 2.3.1

*July 5, 2019*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime |4.0 and later
|Java |8
|IBM CICS TG (for Multiplatforms and for z/OS) |9.1 and 9.2
|IBM CICS TG SDK |9.1 and 9.2
|===

=== Fixed in this Release

* The connector would sometimes incorrect asume that the payload is empty for the operations of executeCommArea and executeMultipleChannels . This was fixed now (SE-12156)

== 2.3.0

*June 27, 2019*

=== Compatibility

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version
|Mule Runtime |4.0 and later
|Java |8
|IBM CICS TG (for Multiplatforms and for z/OS) |9.1 and 9.2
|IBM CICS TG SDK |9.1 and 9.2
|===

=== Features

* *Response Time* is now configurable. This field is located under *Additional Settings* in the connector's configuration.
This timeout is the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that a managed connection attempts to wait for a response to a request. A value of 0 represents no timeout. The default is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).

=== Fixed in this release

* The conector would sometimes incorrectly assume that the input payload is empty. This was fixed, and will now work regardless of the type of InputStream the connector's operations receive. (SE-12156)

== 2.0.0

*January 19, 2018*

IBM CICS Transactions Gateway (IBM CTG) connector is available in Mule 4.0.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Software |Version

|Java | 8
|IBM CICS TG (for Multiplatforms and for z/OS) |9.1 and 9.2
|IBM CICS TG SDK |9.1 and 9.2

Notes:

* The remote CICS TG must be at the same or a higher release level than the version of the JCA resource adapter.
* The JCA resource adapter must match the CICS TG platform. For example, if you have CICS TG for Multiplatforms, you cannot connect to it from a CICS TG with the z/OS resource adapter.

The following JAR files are required to set up a connector configuration:

* ccf2.jar (CICS Common Connector Framework)
* cicsjee.jar (CICS JEE)
* ctgclient.jar (CTG Client Library)
* ctgserver.jar (CTG Server Library)
* geronimo-j2ee-connector_1.6_spec-1.0.jar (JCA 1.6 Specification)

NOTE: JCA 1.6 is needed as a required library to overcome conflicts with JCA 1.5 shipped with the Mule Runtime.

=== Features

* Authentication - The connector uses under the hood, the IPIC (IP interconnectivity) protocol to establish communication with CICS regions over TCP/IP. This type of client also supports SSL authentication.
* Execution of CICS Programs - The connector allows users to invoke CICS programs:
** Using Channels and Containers.
** Using a COMMAREA. Data transfers are limited to 32 KB.
* Transactions - The connector leverages XA Transactions by means of Mule's Transactional scope and the Bitronix Transaction Manager components.
* DataSense - The connector supports adding metadata using through the Custom Metadata Tab option. Using the Copybook feature, a user can import a schema that describes the data structure going in and out of CTG so as to be used by a DataWeave component.

=== Known Issues

* Although the inclusion of JCA 1.6 as a required library is meant to solve compatibility conflicts with the JCA 1.5 shipped with the Mule Runtime, it is yet unknown if this causes side effects.
