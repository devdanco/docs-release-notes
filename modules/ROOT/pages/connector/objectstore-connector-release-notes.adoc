|===
|Software |Version

|ObjectStore|2013
|Java|7
|Anypoint Studio|5 and 6
|===

=== Features

None.

=== Fixed in this Release

*Warning:* This version behaves differently than previous versions when dealing with object store references and partitions. Previously, when setting an object store reference, the `partition` name parameter was ignored. It is now used, and the connector tries to create that partition and use it.

* *`Dispose Store` operation on CloudHub* - The *Dispose Store* operation would not work under CloudHub with Object Store v2. This has been fixed.
* *Partitionable stores* - Previously, the `partition` parameter was ignored when the user provided an Object Store reference. This was changed, and the connector will attempt to create the partition in the given Object Store instance, if it is partitionable.

=== Known Issues

* *`_defaultUserObjectStore` in standalone runtime* - It does not allow creating partitions. If you set it as an `objectstore-ref`, make sure not to set a partition name.

== 2.1.1

*March 2, 2018*

|Software |Version

|===

=== Features

=== Fixed in this Release

* *ClassCastException when target property is defined* - The retrieve method used to fail with a ClassCastException when a "target" property was defined and the payload sent to the connector was non-serializable. This is no longer the case.

=== Known Issues

None.

=== Fixed in this Release

=== Fixed in this Release
