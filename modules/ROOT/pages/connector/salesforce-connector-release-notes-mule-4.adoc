=== Fixed in this Release

* Salesforce invokes Apex metadata request for each invoke. Now the connector does not fetch all the metadata to validate the connection, it only performs a Get Server Timstamp operation which should tell the app if reconnection is necessary or not. (SE-10925)
* Vulnerability reported for Salesforce connector 9.2.2. A part of the vulnerabilities reported were fixed by upgrading some of the dependencies the connector uses. (SE-9824)

=== Fixed in this Release

* Salesforce definition for a relationship (__r usage) threw error. Fixed an issue regarding object relationships in Salesforce. There was a bug causing troubles when creating objects with custom fields that had relationships to other objects. (SE-10599)
* Salesforce Connector return wrong metadata when include a subquery with a list. Fixed output metadata issues for the query operation when there was a subquery included to retrieve related objects. (SE-10255)
* Subscribe topic operation throws `Invalid SObject Type: null` error. Fixed metadata issues for the Subscribe Topic source. There was an exception thrown when trying to retrieve metadata for different object types. (CONN-1660)
* Salesforce Metadata create order issue. There was an issue with reference fields in input metadata, that now is fixed. (SE-10375)
* Salesforce connector create job bulk v 2 operation content type field is not valid. The only valid content type for this operation is CSV. We could not remove the parameter or the other content types, but the field was moved to the Advanced tab and a proper Summary was added for it. The operation is also fail fast (fails without making an API call) if a type other than CSV is specified. (SE-11043)
* Removed the (Deprecated) keyword in the name of the OAuth 2.0 Connection which was added by mistake in a previous release. The connection was not changed and can be used the same way as up until now.

|Salesforce |v37.0, v38.0, v39.0, v40.0, v41.0, v42.0, v43.0
|===

=== New Features

* Added new versions of connection providers for JWT and SAML, because the existing ones do not match the Salesforce API behavior (one session with the same credentials at a time).
+
To change an existing connection type to the new features, change the XML for the `<salesforce:` element as follows (in essence, add `cached-` after `salesforce:` in your XML configuration):
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Previous Value: | Salesforce v9.6 Value:
|salesforce:basic-connection | salesforce:cached-basic-connection

|salesforce:oauth-user-pass-connection | salesforce:cached-oauth-user-pass-connection
|salesforce:config-with-oauth-connection | No change
|===
+
IMPORTANT: The OAuth 2.0 connection type is marked as Deprecated in Studio and Design Center, however OAuth 2.0 is still available. The OAuth 2.0 "(Deprecated)" label can be ignored.
+
The previous values are available but are deprecated. We recommend moving to the new versions.

=== Fixed in this Release

* Improved connection performance when executing operations by making better use of the Mule SDK's thread pools.
* Fixed an issue where the connector was unable to handle empty body requests to Apex services.
* Fixed an issue where for the Retrieve operation when the specified ID was invalid the connector was trying to reconnect because of a wrong exception that was thrown.

|===

=== Fixed in this Release

* Metadata for Apex classes didn't work if an instance had more than 200 records. Fixed by using the search service to query the instance for Apex classes instead of a simple query.
* Null values were set as blank by DataWeave when obtained from the Salesforce Connector. Fixed by changing the returning JSONObject.NULL fields to null.
* Improved the API call that validates the connection to improve connector performance.

|===

=== Fixed in this Release

* Invalid Session ID and Reconnection Strategy works only after multiple invalid requests when this connector performs a concurrent query. Fixed by implementing a new CachedOauthUserPassConnectionProvider with keep-alive functionality.
* GetSessionId was not returning the correct ID after the session was invalidated, because it was not throwing the correct exception. This was fixed by adding a call to the API, that returns a ConnectionException if the session ID is invalid
* The operation "Create Content Version" was failing if the payload was of binary data type. This was fixed by checking the data type before casting to String, so no exception is thrown
* Apex method call recognized an output field as a date if the return string has a similar format as Date. Methods in Apex come with a return type parameter which is now included in the condition which converts a string to a date type.
* Invoking Apex REST was not reconnecting when a session expired. Fixed by properly handling exceptions thrown by the Apex API.
* Fixed problem that occurred when attempting to create a new Content Version that had data as a Base64 format picture, it is not required to decode the Base64 string since the decoding is handled by the connector. 
+
This also impacts SE-9518, this fix is deprecated. Users that have VersionData that is not Base64 must ensure that they convert it to Base64, for example: `VersionData:toBase64(payload)`
+
In short, VersionData for the Version Content expects a Base64 format.

|===

=== Fixed in this Release

* The clearNullFields config parameter was not used properly and its functionality would have never worked. Fixed the way clearNullFields is handled and now works as intended.
* Fixed Salesforce Connector not reconnecting when a Bulk operation session expired. Fixed by changing the exception thrown in this case.
* Retrieve record failure Bulk v2 not failing because of column delimiter. Fixed by adding handling for a column delimiter for the retrieve record failure Bulk v2.
* Invalid Session ID and Reconnection Strategy works only after multiple invalid requests when the Mule connector performs a concurrent query. Fixed by implementing a new CachedBasicConnectionProvider with keep-alive functionality. 
* The BasicConnectionProvider was deprecated because a PoolingConnectionProvider does not have sense in the context of Salesforce's way of handling multiple logins, which returns the same sessionId.
* Username Password connection provider was improved by handling invalid connections currently in the pool, so before executing an operation, the connector ensures that the operation uses a valid connection.

+
* The customer couldn't make APEX call without parameters with array payload.
+
The problem was solved by treated the lists of parameters separately.
+
* When using the Salesforce connector inside a batch job that uses the Batch Aggregator with the Upsert operation, the records were not being marked as failed or successful because the result was not being returned as BulkOperationResult.
+
The problem was solved by adding 4 new operations for create, update, upsert, and delete that return BulkOperationResult.

=== Features

* Added the isForceResubscribe method in Salesforce Bayeux Client.
* Support for Anypoint Studio Proxy configuration as the default.

=== Fixed in this Release

 * Trigger operation did not retrieve MetadataKeysId. Solved by adding support for retrieving metadata in case of sources.
 * Reply topic was losing messages in case the connection has been lost for less than 40 seconds; this is the amount of time that was needed to trigger re-subscribe naturally according to Salesforce documentation. The issue was solved by forcing re-subscription whenever the network connection is lost.
 * Buffering capacity exceeded message was triggered when the connector consumed more than 10000 messages from a topic. The issue was solved by adding a new attribute for the "Replay streaming channel" operation: Buffer Size In Bytes, it's an optional parameter with the default value of 26 MB.
 * Wrong transformation of fields of type Date. Trying to update or insert an Object in Salesforce with fields of type Date caused a failure, this was due to failure in serializing the objects of type Date. The issue was solved by parsing the values received from the Mule flow and converting them into the expected Salesforce accepted format.
