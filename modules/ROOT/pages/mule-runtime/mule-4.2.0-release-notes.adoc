= Mule Runtime 4.2.0 Release Notes
:keywords: mule, 4.2.0, runtime, release notes

*May 6, 2019*

Mule Runtime 4.2.0 includes the following enhancements, changes, and fixes.

== Mule Runtime Features and Enhancements

* Fedramp support
* Performance improvements
* Faster start time
* <<java_11>>

[[java_11]]
=== Java 11 support

* Java support is extended to Java 11. Note that AdoptOpenJDK 8 is
recommended over Java 11 and other Java 8 SDKs.
+
In addition:
+
  ** Your app development and production environments should run on the
     the same JDK versions.
  ** For custom connectors built with the Mule SDK, you
     still need to compile against Java 8, but MuleSoft supports running
     them on Java 11 or Java 8.
  ** At the moment, the following connectors only support Java 8:
  *** DotNet
  *** Dynamics CRM
  *** Dynamics NAV
  *** Netsuite
  *** Oracle EBS 12.1
  *** Oracle EBS 12.2

* To configure JDK 11 in Anypoint Studio, see xref:7.3@studio::change-jdk-config-in-projects.adoc[Change the JDK from Studio].

== API Gateway Features and Enhancements

* Improved security, which allows for the encryption of credentials used
to configure the connection between the runtime and Anypoint Platform,
as well as encrypting all sensitive information stored by the Gateway,
such as policies configuration and contracts.
* Analytics can now be configured to send data both to Anypoint Platform
and to process the events through Anypoint Runtime Manager. The latest allows
you to set third-party systems such as Splunk to consume the Analytics info.
* This version introduces support to use Mule 4.0’s OAuth 2.0 Provider for the
“OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using Mule OAuth Provider” policy.
* Performance improvements on policies and proxy applications.
* To reduce log verbosity, some logs where moved from INFO to DEBUG level:
 ** `{} events from {} were sent to analytics ingest`
 ** `Starting API Gateway runnables`

== DataWeave Features and Enhancements

* DataWeave 2.2.0 is released as part of Mule 4.2.

* New DataWeave Language Syntax:
 ** New support for annotations. The annotation processor is native only.
 ** DataWeave introduces the `!` as an alternative to `not` operator.
+
NOTE: Though the semantics is the same, the precedence is different.
`not true | true` returns `false`, and `!true|true` return `true`
because `not` has a lower precedence and is therefore executed as
`not (true|true)`.

* New and Modified DataWeave Function Modules:
** Arrays (dw::core::Arrays) has new functions: `drop`, `dropWhile`, `indexOf`,
`indexWhere`,`join`, `leftJoin`, `outerJoin`, `partition`, `slice`, `splitAt`,
`splitWhere` `take`, `takeWhile`
** Binaries (`dw::core::Binaries`) has new functions: `readLinesWith` and
`writeLinesWith`
** Core (`dw:Core`) includes a new data type and a number of annotations:
  *** `TailRec` annotation: Validates that a function is tail recursive.
  *** `DesignOnlyType` annotation
  *** `StreamCapable` annotation
  *** `Pair` type
** Crypto (`dw::Crypto`): The `algorithm` parameter to the `HMACWith`
   function is new. It supports custom algorithms.
** DataFormat (`dw::extension::DataFormat`) is new and has all the functionality
   needed to define a custom data format (`DataFormat`) in DataWeave. The module
   includes its own types and annotations.
** Mule (`Mule`) module and all of its functions and types are new.
** Multipart (`dw::module::Multipart`)  and all its functions and types are new.
** Numbers (`dw::core::Numbers`) is a new DataWeave function module:
   `fromBinary`, `fromHex`, `fromRadixNumber`, `toBinary`, `toHex`,
   `toRadixNumber`
** Runtime (`dw::Runtime`) has new functions: `orElseTry` and `orElse`
** Strings (`dw::core::Strings`) has new functions:  `appendIfMissing`,
   `isAlpha`, `isAlphanumeric`, `isNumeric`, `isUpperCase`, `isLowerCase`,
   `isWhitespace`, `leftPad`, `prependIfMissing`, `repeat`, `rightPad`,
   `substringAfter`,  `substringAfterLast`, `substringBefore`,
   `substringBeforeLast`, `unwrap`, `wrapWith`, `wrapIfMissing`,

=== Runtime-related Features in DataWeave

* Encoding:
+
Starting in Mule 4.2, the default encoding is no longer the system
encoding but the encoding from the Mule app. This change is unlikely
to affect your Mule apps.

* New data formats:
 ** Avro (`application/avro`)
 ** ndjson (`application/x-ndjson`)
 ** Java Properties (`text/x-java-properties`)

* Multipart supports bigger than memory.

* New DataWeave reader and writer properties for supported formats:
** JSON:
  *** Writer property:
    **** `writeAttributes`: To keep the attributes (`false` by default).
    **** `deferred`: To force the execution to be deferred. This means that
         execution takes place on demand, which is useful for full streaming.
  *** Reader property:
    **** `streaming`: To enable streaming mode on the JSON reader. It only works
          for values that are arrays.
** Java:
   *** Writer properties:
     **** `writeAttributes`: To keep the attributes (`false` by default).
     **** `duplicatedKeysAsArray`: If there are duplicated keys, write it as an
           array (false by default)
     **** `writeAttributes`: To keep the attributes (`false` by default).
  *** Reader property:
     **** `streaming`: To enable streaming mode on the JSON reader. It only works
           for values that are arrays.
** All (except for Java):
   *** `deferred`: To force the execution to be deferred. This means that
       execution takes place on demand, which is useful for full streaming.

* New experimental option: There is a new tool for dumping the entire context
when a scripting fails. This is useful for reproducing any issue in a more
isolated environment:
 ** `-Dcom.mulesoft.dw.dump_files=true`: Dumps the context on an exception.
 ** `-Dcom.mulesoft.dw.dump_folder`: Specifies the directory in which to dump
     the context. The default is the `tmp` directory.


== Known Limitations and Workarounds

[%header,cols="15a,85a"]
|===
|Issue |Description
| MULE-16742 | XML attachment is corrupted when sent as multipart/form-data
| MULE-16735 | XML transformation to JSON fails when ? present in large payload
| MULE-16696 | Schedulers unavailable after disposing policies (rarely)
| MULE-16668 | Excessive validations on pooled connections.
| MULE-15752 | InjectParamsFromContextServiceMethodInvoker makes excessive registry lookups
|===

=== API Gateway Known Limitations and Workarounds

The HTTP Caching Policy v1.0.0 has been deprecated and is not compatible with Mule Runtime v4.2.0. Customers need to use or upgrade to v1.0.1 of the policy. The latest version introduces many bug fixes as well as performance improvements. Version 1.0.0 will continue to work with v4.1.x of the Runtime but customers are encouraged to upgrade to v1.0.1.

Customers that process analytic events through Anypoint Runtime Manager and send them to an external database need to run a migration because one field type was modified. It was modified to fix a bug with automated policies and for the reporting of policy violations. See xref:runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-2.3.0-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent 2.3.0 Release Notes].

== Upgrade Requirements

[%header,cols="15a,85a"]
|===
|Issue |Description
| MULE-15586 | `lookup` function in DataWeave now has a `timeout`. The `timeout` for a specific `lookup` call can be increased by providing the new value with a third parameter (for example, `lookup(vars.flow, payload, 10000)`).
| MULE-15730 | TLS keystore entries must now reference at least one key to use or reference a key alias. Using an invalid keystore will result in an initialization failure.
| MULE-14203 | In `scheduler-pools.conf`, some default values for the file changed. Please apply these changes if this configuration file is being carried over from a previous version:

`org.mule.runtime.scheduler.io.workQueue.size` from `1024` to `0`
`org.mule.runtime.scheduler.cpuIntensive.workQueue.size` from `1024` to `2 * cores`
