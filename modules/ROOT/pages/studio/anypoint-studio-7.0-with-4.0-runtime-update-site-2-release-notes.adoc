== Migration Guide

For first time installment, please refer to xref:studio/anypoint-studio-7.0-EA-with-4.0-runtime-release-notes.adoc[Anypoint Studio 7.0.0 EA with Mule Runtime Engine 4.0.0 Release Notes] for hardware requirements and known issues.

Studio 7 only supports Mule 4 projects. The structure of the project, export format, XML and scripting language are different. +
Users must migrate Mule 3 projects to Mule 4 manually, before they can be used in Studio 7. See xref:mule-runtime::migration-core.adoc[Migrating Core Components] for a list of changes.

From the previous version of Studio 7.0 there is no special migration needed.
