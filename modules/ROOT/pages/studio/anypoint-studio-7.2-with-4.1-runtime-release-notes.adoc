== Migration Guide

Studio 7.1 only supports Mule 4.x projects. The structure of the project, export format, XML and scripting language are different. +
Users must migrate Mule 3 projects to Mule 4 manually, before they can be used in Studio 7.

=== Workspace Compatibility

Projects created or updated with Studio 7.2.0 are not compatible with 7.1.x due to some improvements with the management of the mule-artifcat.json file. The content of the file was reduced and part of that content used to be required by Studio 7.1.x. +
To fix this issue you only need to update Studio to the latest 7.2.x version available. See xref:7.2@studio::update-workspace.adoc[Updating Workspaces] for more information.

Workspaces created using Anypoint Studio 6.x or below are not compatible with Anypoint Studio 7 workspaces.

== JIRA Ticket List for Anypoint Studio

=== Known Issues

* Some existing features in Studio 6.x are not yet supported in Studio 7.1: Custom Policies, API Sync, Anypoint Private Cloud.
* Anypoint Studio uses your configured default browser to display web content such as Exchange and the Runtime Manager UI when deploying an application to Anypoint Platform. If your default internet browser does not display this content correctly, you can configure Anypoint Studio to use a Mozilla/XULRunner runtime environment as the underlying renderer for the Web UI. +
Follow the xref:7.1@studio::faq-default-browser-config.adoc[FAQ: Troubleshooting Issues with Your Default OS Browser] for more details.
* Copybook import fails with no message.
* Copybook import file not copied to project.
* Mule modules needs to provide icons, today many of the modules have the generic icon.
* Running application "pom.xml" is not updated when changing dependencies.
* Debugger: payload shown while debugging is partial but there is no way to view the rest of the payload.
* Mule plugins with snapshot versions should always be regenerated.
* Datasense/Runtime not working correctly through proxy on connectors using TCP/IP or connectors which don’t yet support it.
* When importing a project with a runtime that is not installed in Studio there is no notification to the user.
* Using the "Validate" option in your Mule configuration files is not supported. +
In your Package Explorer view, when right-clicking your Mule configuration file and selecting *Validate*, Studio runs a non-supported validation inherited from Eclipse. It is not recommended to use this feature. +
You can choose to disable these validators:
+
** *At Workspace level*: By clicking *Preferences*, *Validation*, and disabling "Manual" and "Build" checkbox for *XML Schema Validator* and *XML Validator*.
** *At Project level*: By righ-clicking on your project in your Package Explorer View, select *Properties*, *Validation*, and disabling "Manual" and "Build" checkbox for *XML Schema Validator* and *XML Validator*.
