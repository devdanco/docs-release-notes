=== Runtime Compatibility

* Studio 7.3.0 comes bundled with Mule Runtime Engine 4.1.4, however you can use it with earlier Mule Runtime versions as early as 4.1.1.

=== Studio Compatibility

* Projects created or updated with Studio 7.3.x or 7.2.x are not compatible with 7.1.x due to some improvements with the management of the mule-artifact.json file. The content of the file was reduced and part of the content used to be required by Studio 7.1.x. +
To fix this issue, you only need to update Studio to the latest 7.2.x version available. See xref:studio::update-workspace.adoc[Updating Workspaces] for more information.
* Workspaces created using Anypoint Studio 6.x or below are not compatible with Anypoint Studio 7 workspaces.

== What's New

* Dataweave Everywhere. +
You can now toggle between "literal" and "Expression" modes using the new expression button. +
When clicking the "Expression" mode, you can use auto-suggestions for Dataweave 2.0.
+

Additionally, using the *expression mode*, you can click the *New Map* button next to *Fields* to use the visual mapper to build expressions for individual fields.
+

* Debugger Improvements. +
** Studio features a cleaned up debugger view to help you inspect payload data. Right clicking on an object shows a contextual menu that includes:
*** *Update Value* - Enables you to modify data on the fly to test flows.
*** *Go to class* - Opens the selected class.
*** *Copy expression* - Copies the Dataweave expression used to access the value (e.g.: payload.0.filename).
*** *Add watch* - Automatically adds a new watch with the expression to access the value to the Watches menu.
*** *Copy value* - Copies the Dataweave expression representing the structure of the selected object.

+

== Known Issues

* Studio 7 only supports Mule 4.x projects. Due to the structure of projects, export format, xml and scripting language differences, we do not offer backwards compatibility with Mule 3.x runtimes.
* Some existing features in Studio 6.x are not yet supported in Studio 7: Custom Policies, API Sync, Anypoint Private Cloud.
* Anypoint Studio uses your configured default browser to display web content such as Exchange and the Runtime Manager UI when deploying an application to Anypoint Platform. If your default internet browser does not display this content correctly, you can configure Anypoint Studio to use a Mozilla/XULRunner runtime environment as the underlying renderer for the Web UI. +
Follow the xref:7.1@studio::faq-default-browser-config.adoc[FAQ: Troubleshooting Issues with Your Default OS Browser] for more details.
